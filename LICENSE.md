# Responsive Source License (RSL) v1.0

**Copyright (c) 2024-2026 Rasa Novum.**

We value our community and encourage contributions, bug reports, and addons that enhance The Work for everyone. This license is designed to protect our work while fostering a collaborative modding ecosystem.

## 1. Definitions

* **"The Work"** refers to all code (software, scripts, binaries), assets (artwork, textures, models, sounds, music), and documentation produced by Rasa Novum and licensed under this License.
* **"Official Sources"** refers to distribution channels officially designated by Rasa Novum, including but not limited to: CurseForge, Modrinth, and Rasa Novum GitHub repositories.
* **"Addon"** refers to a separate software project that requires The Work to be present as a dependency to function, but does not bundle or redistribute The Work’s compiled binaries or assets.
* **"Contributor"** refers to any individual or entity that submits code, assets, or documentation to The Work that is accepted by Rasa Novum.

## 2. Ownership & Asset Protection

The Work is the intellectual property of Rasa Novum. This license protects both the source code and the associated assets. While the source code is made available to the community to demonstrate functionality, encourage learning, and facilitate community contributions, this does not constitute a transfer of ownership or a right to redistribute the Work or its assets.

## 3. General Redistribution & Hosting Restrictions

Except as provided in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7, you may **not** host, mirror, or redistribute compiled versions (e.g., JAR files) of The Work, including forks, ports, backports, or unofficial updates on any public platform without express permission from Rasa Novum.

## 4. Forking & Personal Use

You may fork the source code of The Work and compile it for:
* Personal use (including sharing with friends in private contexts)
* Educational purposes
* Development of contributions intended to be submitted back to Official Sources
* Development of addons relying on The Work

Public source code forks are permitted on platforms like GitHub for transparency and collaboration purposes. However, you may not distribute compiled binaries (e.g., JAR files) of forked versions through public channels (modding platforms, public file hosts, community websites) except as permitted in Section 7.

## 5. Addons & Dependencies

You are encouraged to create **Addons** for The Work.
* Addons may interface with The Work’s API and public methods.
* Addons **must** require the user to download the original Work from an **Official Source**.
* You may not bundle The Work's assets or code inside your Addon’s binary.

## 6. Modpack Policy

You are granted permission to include The Work in publicly distributed modpacks, provided that:
* The modpack is distributed on platforms that utilize the Official Source API (e.g., CurseForge or Modrinth), ensuring the download counts and traffic are attributed to Rasa Novum. Modpack launchers that fetch mods directly from these Official Sources are permitted.
* The Work is not modified or repackaged in a way that bypasses the Official Sources.

## 7. Redistribution Requirements

Permission to redistribute or host a modified version of The Work is automatically granted if, and only if, the following conditions are met:
1. A formal request for permission was submitted as a public issue on the **Official GitHub Repository** associated with the project.
2. The Copyright Holder (Rasa Novum) has not provided a response (approval or denial) within 90 consecutive days from the date the GitHub issue was opened.
3. The requester must maintain the public GitHub issue as a permanent, timestamped record of the request and the lack of response.

## 8. Patent Protection

Each contributor to The Work grants a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the contributed code portions of the Work. If you institute patent litigation against Rasa Novum or any contributor alleging that the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to you under this License for the Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 9. Warranty & Liability

THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. IN NO EVENT SHALL RASA NOVUM BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK.

## 10. Severability

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

## 11. Governing Law

This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of British Columbia, Canada, excluding its conflict of law rules.

## 12. License Versions

Rasa Novum may publish revised versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Unless otherwise specified, The Work is always governed by the most recent version of the Responsive Source License published by Rasa Novum.
